# autodiff-ts

## Overview
autodiff-ts is a TypeScript library for automatic differentiation. It provides a set of functions for computing the derivative of a mathematical expression with respect to a variable.

Automatic differentiation (TODO: add citation) is a technique for computationally determining the gradient of a function with respect to its inputs, for a certain point. It strikes a balance between the precision of symbolic differentiation and the efficiency of numerical differentiation.
